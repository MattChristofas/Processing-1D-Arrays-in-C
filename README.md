# Processing-1D-Arrays-in-C
Functions that can be used to process 1-dimensional arrays.

1. The program creates a random 1-dimensional array of 40 integers ranging from 0 to 100.
  
2. Next, the program prompts the user for both a low-range and high-range. The program then returns the highest number within the provided range.

3. The program then prompts the user for another low and high range with which the program reverses the elements in the array within the given range (1,2,3) -> (3,2,1)

4. The final prompt is for the user to enter two integers as such "10 20" and the program will scan the array looking to see if 10 and 20 appear sequentially anywhere in the array.
